## Table Structure

There is a set of base tables that can be included for each Segment schema (note that Segment refers to each schema as a project in its documentation, but referring to it as schema will alleviate confusion between a Segment Project and a Looker Project). Note that **not all of these tables are required**, and the subset included will be dependent on the Segment implementation. The documentation from the Segment website is [here](https://segment.com/docs/warehouses/), but below is a Looker-relevant summary (Screens and Groups are not currently part of the template but can be incorpoated as needed):


* **Tracks**: Event Data
* **Pages**: Page View Data
* **Aliases**: Helps with user identification by providing a list of previous and current user ids when user id changes
* **Identifies**: Provides information about users
* **Users**: A table with unique identify calls. identify calls are upserted on user_id into this table (updated if an existing entry exists, appended otherwise). This table holds the latest state of of a user. The id column in the users table is equivalent to the user_id column in the identifies table. Also note that this table won’t have an anonymous_id column since a user can have multiple anonymousIds. To get at a user’s anonymousIds, you’ll need to query the identifies table. If you observer any duplicates in the users table, email friends@segment.com.
* **Groups**: A table with all of your group method calls. This table will include all of the traits you record for groups as top-level columns, for example `<project>.groups.employee_count`.
* **Accounts**: A table with unique group method calls. Group calls are upserted into this table (updated if an existing entry exists, appended otherwise). This table holds the latest state of a group.
* **Screens**: Includes all of the properties recorded for screens

Additional tables will exist **for each event type** in the format `<schema>.<event>`.  Additional metadata may be of use in these tables specific to certain event types, and joins to these tables will require additional customizations based on the clients requests, but can be handled after the initial model build. Note that id or event id of these tables is NOT a primary key.

## Should I use Views or Tables?
Each of the tables listed above has a _view counterpart, which Segment includes to de-duplicate data and ensure that you are querying unique events. These are logical views, not materialized views, meaning they will execute at query time every time they are referenced. Because BigQuery bills based on the amount of data processed, Segment recommends that you set a destination table for de-duped data and query that table instead. For simplicity, this Block queries the _views, but depending on the volume of data this may have significant cost implications for your instance. To read more about best practices for reducing BigQuery costs, see Segment's [documentation](https://segment.com/docs/destinations/bigquery/#schema).

**Note:** by default, views are setup to look at only the last 60 days, but this can be updated to whatever timeframe meets your needs by changing the view definition in BigQuery.
